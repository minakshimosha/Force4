Implementations:
a. Feedback updated back to original Case created through different ways like data loading, external system, csv/json files.
b. For demo, we have already updated Cases with feedbacks in case comments field of respective cases and ran the sentiment analysis which mass updated the feedback sentiment.
c. Also we demonstrated 4 original Cases and closed those cases with case comment(feedback) manually and ran the Sentiment Analysis.
d. On success, the feedback Sentiments were updated with Positive, Negative and Neutral values on these four cases.
e. As per requirement, new Feedback Case got automatically created for Negative feedback and displayed under the original parent case for easy tracking.
